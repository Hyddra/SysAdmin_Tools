# Problem solving:
#   - think about the big picture
#   - if the big picture is visual, do a sketch
#   - break the problem into smaller problems
#   - brainstorm solution to those smaller problems
#   - experiment
#   - solve
#   - combine smaller solutions together for a big solution
#   - refine overall solution
